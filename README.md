# Open Data for Nonprofit Research

This project has been created in response to recent efforts to make data on the nonprofit sector open for research and analysis in order to make the sector more transparent and research more dynamic. 

As a result of a concernted effort by advocates the IRS has made 990 tax data on public charities and foundations available in free, machine-readable formats. For some background on these campaigns, see these articles and blogs:

* [Liberating 990 Data](http://ssir.org/articles/entry/liberating_990_data): Stanford Social Innovation Review
* [The Nonprofit Data Project Blog](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/program-on-philanthropy-and-social-innovation-psi/nonprofit-data-project-updates/): The Aspen Institute
* [IRS Plans to Begin Releasing Electronically Filed Nonprofit Tax Data](https://philanthropy.com/article/IRS-Plans-to-Begin-Releasing/231265): Chronicle of Philanthropy

These developments represent significant strides forward in making data open and timely. Unfortunately the data have been released in formats that are not always easy to use - ASCII text files, json files, and XML queries. In order to make the data accessible to the research community, we have created some scripts to download data from IRS websites, clean and process it, and export into familiar formats (CSV, Stata, SPSS, etc.).

Tools are currently available for the following resources:

* Download the List of Electronic Filers (990, 990-EZ, 990-PF) from 2011 to Present
* Download the Postcard 990-N Filers 
* Download the Database of Automatic Revocations of Tax Exempt Status
* Download the IRS Database of All Exempt Organizations

> Form 990 was first used for the tax year ending in 1941. It was as a two-page form. Organizations were also required to include a schedule with the names and addresses of payees who had given the organization at least $4,000 during the year.

> The form reached four pages (including instructions) in 1947. In 1976 this was increased to 5.5 pages (including instructions), with 8 pages for Schedule A. By 2000 this was 6 pages for Form 990, 42 pages for instructions, 6 pages for Schedule A, and at least 2 pages for Schedule B. This increase is due to use of a larger font and inclusion of sections that are only required for some organizations.

> Starting in 2000, political organizations were required to file Form 990.

> In June 2007, the IRS released a new Form 990 that requires significant disclosures on corporate governance and boards of directors. These new disclosures are required for all nonprofit filers for the 2009 tax year, with more significant reporting requirements for nonprofits with over $1 million in revenues or $2.5 million in assets.
