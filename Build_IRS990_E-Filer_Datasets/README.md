# Build IRS E-Filer Datasets

This folder contains a set of functions that allow you to scrape nonprofit IRS 990 E-Filer data stored as XML files on Amazon's Web Server platform, and transform them into research databases. It also contains documentation for the process, including the Data Dictionary that defines all of the variables and production steps included in the research database.

See which variables are currently available in the [Data Dictionary](https://github.com/lecy/Open-Data-for-Nonprofit-Research/blob/master/Build_IRS990_E-Filer_Datasets/Data_Dictionary.md).

The processed research database can be downloaded directly from Dataverse.



## Open IRS 990 Data

The IRS has released electronically-filed 990 returns as XML files posted on AWS that look like this:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/201541349349307794_public.xml

This format is challenging for scholars that are used to flat spreadsheets. We are creating some guides to working with this data in the R programming language (any community submissions for Stata or Python scripts are welcome).

## Build a Dataset of 990 Returns

We have created a program to convert the 990 returns for a specified set of organizations and years from individual XML files into a single spreadsheet format to make it useful for analysis. 

To see the mechanics of building a dataset from the online returns, try the script below with this sample of 10 nonprofits which is a subset from the full [e-filers database](https://github.com/lecy/Open-Data-for-Nonprofit-Research/blob/master/Open_Nonprofit_Datasets/IRS_E-Filers_Index.Rmd). It will scrape the data from the XML files posted by the IRS and return available data as a flat spreadsheet.

The missing value NA's indicate either that the nonprofit did not provide information, or in some cases that the full 990 contains the questions but the 990-EZ does not (see the data dictionary for more information). 

## Data Modules

This table presents an basic overview of the sections of the 990 form, whether each section is included in the 990 exclusively or also in the 990-EZ.

There are other modules that function more like relational databases. The 990 returns contain information about board members or individual grants made by private foundations. These sections have a one-to-many relationship (many board members are associated with each nonprofit), and are better built as a separate table that can be linked to a nonprofit through the EIN rather than adding them to the same database because of the structure of the data. 



## Advantages of the Open IRS Database

In addition to information currently available in NCCS Core files, we can include additional information that was not previously accessible such as lists of board members and specific Schedules.

The IRS releases new data every couple of months as it is available, so it is more-or-less in real time as nonprofits submit their returns. Alternatively, there is a 2-3 year time lag between when data is filed and when it is released by NCCS.


## Limitations of the Open IRS Database

We have modeled the database off of the The NCCS core datasets, as it has been the industry standard for scholarship for years. The NCCS core data dictionary is [available here](http://nccsweb.urban.org/PubApps/dd2.php?close=1&form=Core+2013+PC).

There are several limitations of the open IRS data relative to the core files:

* The IRS open data only includes organizations that have filed electronically (approximately 60% of all 990 and 990-EZ filers, and all organizations with revenues above $10 million). 
* The current IRS data does not include NTEE codes.
* The data has a street address, but is not geocoded or matched to county or MSA FIPS codes (which are necessary to merge with census data). 
 
Another limitation of all of these datasets is that the 990EZ forms contain a small subset of variables contained in the full 990 form. Any variables that do not have
