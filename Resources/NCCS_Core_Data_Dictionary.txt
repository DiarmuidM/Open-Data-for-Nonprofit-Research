990EZ (DocCD=09 and 92): Part I, Line 2

IMPORTANT NOTE: Amounts reported as DUES in Part I, Line 3 of Form 990 prior to tax year 2008 are reported as Program Service Revenue in Part VIII, Line 2g (PROGREV) of Form 990 beginning in tax year 2008. For this reason, DUES is not available in Core PC and CO files circa 2011 and newer. For this reason, the following adjustment will be necessary for comparison of PROGREV and DUES revenue components in Core files prior to 2011: [PROGREV+DUES in Core files prior to 2011] = [PROGREV in Core files 2011 and later]. Due to Form 990 revisions in tax year 2008: NCCS strongly recommends combining DUES and PROGREV revenue components for all analysis involving Core files containing both Old 990 (DocCD=90) and New 990 (DocCD=93) return data (Core files 2008-2010), and for all time-series analysis spanning Core file years 2008 and newer.
