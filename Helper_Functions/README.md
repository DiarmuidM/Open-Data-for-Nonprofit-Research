# Build IRS E-Filer Datasets

This folder contains a set of functions that allow you to scrape nonprofit IRS 990 E-Filer data stored as XML files on Amazon's Web Server platform, and transform them into research databases.

It also contains documentation for the process, including the Data Dictionary that defines all of the variables and production steps included in the research database.

The processed research database can be downloaded directly from Dataverse.
